These stem cells reside in a niche at the base of the crypt, which controls their behavior and maintains the stem cell's homeostasis through a variety of signaling pathways and interactions. Several attempts have been made to define markers that can identify colonic stem cells, the most useful of which is Lgr5, a Wnt target gene. Although the crypt base contains several stem cells, each colonic crypt comprises a single clone of cells. Investigators have attempted to reconcile these apparently contradictory observations by conducting research into stem cell division. The propagation of stem-cell-acquired mutations through a crypt results in a monocryptal adenoma that, through crypt fission, develops into a microadenoma. Some early adenomas become polyclonal through an as yet unknown mechanism. The discovery of subpopulations of cancer cells that can initiate tumors when implanted into mice has renewed interest in the existence of cancer stem cells, especially with regard to their implications for the use of chemotherapy. Various potential markers of cancer stem cells have been investigated, particularly CD133, but the cancer stem cell theory still has some limitations.","tags":[],"title":"Field cancerization in Barrett's esophagus.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeki S","Fitzgerald RC."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"1f725486fffd02c0455a5b3e8308646d","permalink":"/publication/targetingcare/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/targetingcare/","section":"publication","summary":"Barretts oesophagus represents the most significant risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), although the majority of patients will not develop cancer. However, early detection of OAC and its precursors significantly improves outcome and underlines the importance of endoscopic surveillance programmes. Clearly there is a discrepancy between the small number of people who need to undergo surveillance because they are at significant progression risk, and the large number that do. Research is therefore now concentrated on risk stratification. Currently such stratification is currently based on clinical findings, endoscopic diagnosis and histopathological grade. Histopathology can be imperfect and is likely to require molecular confirmation of different grades, thus molecular stratification is becoming more important in this regard and p53 immunohistochemistry is already clinically useful, with other molecular biomarkers likely to prove beneficial in the future. The hope is that non-endoscopic methods, such as the Cytosponge may be able to combine molecular biomarkers with histopathology and therefore perhaps benefit a population screening as well as a surveillance programme.","tags":[],"title":"Targeting care in Barrett's oesophagus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lavery DL","Nicholson AM","Poulsom R","Jeffery R","Hussain A","Gay LJ","Jankowski JA","Zeki SS","Barr H","Harrison R"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"1f9df783c59a78b1dafc266d2a0b1035","permalink":"/publication/stemcellorganisationandproliferative/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stemcellorganisationandproliferative/","section":"publication","summary":"POBJECTIVE: Barrett's oesophagus shows appearances described as 'intestinal metaplasia', in structures called 'crypts' but do not typically display crypt architecture. Here, we investigate their relationship to gastric glands. METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration within Barrett's glands was assessed by Ki67 and iododeoxyuridine (IdU) labelling. Expression of mucin core proteins (MUC), trefoil family factor (TFF) peptides and LGR5 mRNA was determined by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridisation, and clonality was elucidated using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations combined with mucin histochemistry. RESULTS: Proliferation predominantly occurs in the middle of Barrett's glands, diminishing towards the surface and the base: IdU dynamics demonstrate bidirectional migration, similar to gastric glands. Distribution of MUC5AC, TFF1, MUC6 and TFF2 in Barrett's mirrors pyloric glands and is preserved in Barrett's dysplasia. MUC2-positive goblet cells are localised above the neck in Barrett's glands, and TFF3 is concentrated in the same region. LGR5 mRNA is detected in the middle of Barrett's glands suggesting a stem cell niche in this locale, similar to that in the gastric pylorus, and distinct from gastric intestinal metaplasia. Gastric and intestinal cell lineages within Barrett's glands are clonal, indicating derivation from a single stem cell. CONCLUSIONS:Barrett's shows the proliferative and stem cell architecture, and pattern of gene expression of pyloric gastric glands, maintained by stem cells showing gastric and intestinal differentiation: neutral drift may suggest that intestinal differentiation advances with time, a concept critical for the understanding of the origin and development of Barrett's oesophagus.","tags":[],"title":"The stem cell organisation, and the proliferative and gene expression profile of Barrett's epithelium, replicates pyloric-type gastric glands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeki S","Fitzgerald RC."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"e0c4c3dd6bf034ca2a841e3765cd8240","permalink":"/publication/molecularmarkers/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/molecularmarkers/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to stratify patients based on the risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma would provide benefit to patients as well as deliver a more cost effective surveillance programme. Current practice is to survey all patients with Barrett's oesophagus (BO) and use histological diagnoses to guide further management. However, reliance on histology alone has its drawbacks. We are currently unable to reliably stratify the risk of progression of patients with non-dysplastic BO based on any particular histological feature. There is also considerable variability in histological interpretation. An obvious recourse has been to rely on identifying molecular features possibly as an adjunct to histology, to better diagnose and stratify patients. To this end, p53 immunohistochemistry can be used as a useful adjunct to risk stratify and clarify histological grades, particularly low-grade dysplasia. Other markers of progression, although not yet in a clinically applicable format, are promising. Measurements of promoter methylation and also genomic instability such as loss of heterozygosity and copy number alterations show promise especially as high throughput genetic technologies reach maturity. The enduring hope is that these molecular biomarkers will make the transition to clinical applicability either in the direct endoscopic setting or even using non-endoscopic methods.","tags":[],"title":"The use of molecular markers in predicting dysplasia and guiding treatment.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

However, in 20% of cases RFA fails to return the epithelium to squamous phenotype. Follow-up studies show a similar dysplasia recurrence rate. We hypothesize that failed RFA is due to clonally mutated epithelial populations harbored in RFA-privileged sites and that RFA can select for the mutant clonal expansionMETHODS:A longitudinal case series of 19 patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma were studied. DNA was extracted from individual Barrett's glands, deep esophageal glands within mucosal resections and biopsy specimens before and after RFA. Mutations were identified by targeted sequencing of genes commonly mutated in Barrett's adenocarcinoma.RESULTS:Five patients demonstrated persistent post-RFA pathology with persistent mutations, sometimes detected in deep esophageal glands or neighboring squamous epithelium after several rounds of RFA preceded by mucosal resection. Recurrence of pathology in three other patients was characterized by de novo mutations.CONCLUSIONS:Protumorigenic mutations can be found in post-ablation squamous mucosa as well as in mutant deep esophageal glands; both are associated with dysplasia recurrence. Following RFA, non-dysplastic Barrett's epithelium can contain mutant clones that are found in a subsequent adenocarcinoma. Ablation may also drive the clonal expansion of pre-existing clones after a “bottleneck” created by the RFA. Overall, recurrence of dysplasia post RFA reflects the multicentric origins of Barrett's clones and highlights the role of clonal selection in carcinogenesis.","tags":[],"title":"Clonal Selection and Persistence in Dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus and Intramucosal Cancers After Failed Radiofrequency Ablation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Zeki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"7672e455307c75800bd123b41cc3b8fe","permalink":"/publication/endominer/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/endominer/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical data is increasingly kept in an electronic format worldwide (Bretthauer M. 2016).This serves many purposes including more efficient storage, distribution and accessibility of patient-focussed data. As important is the ability to analyse healthcare data for to optimize resource deployment and usage. The tools for the analysis are often statistical and rely on the provision of ‘clean’ datasets before this can be done. ‘Cleaning’ a dataset is often the most difficult aspect of any data analysis and involves the provision of meaningful and well-formatted data so that the interpretation of the analysis is not subject to the doubts of the data quality. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends that all endoscopic data is kept in an electronic format particularly to facilitate audit and maintain standards through the Global Rating Scale (GRS) (Stebbing J. 2011). The endoscopic dataset is however only part of the patient’s story as many aspects of a patient’s gastroenterological care depend on the results of histopathological analysis of tissue taken during the examination. Pathology results are often available many days after the endoscopic result and usually stored in a separate data repository, although this may change with the arrival of an encompassing electronic patient record. Regardless of the method of storage, it is often difficult to associate the particular histopathological result with an endoscopic result. Further, even if the two data sets can be merged, a problem occurs in the isolation of various parts of each report such that each part can be individually analysed. Examples include the isolation of who the endoscopist was or the presence of dysplasia within a histopathology report. This is all the more difficult if the report is unstructured or partially structured free text. However if this can be done then many downstream analyses which benefit individual patients as well as the department, can be automated and include more complex analyses to determine follow-up regimes or endoscopic –pathologic lesion recognition performance. The EndoMineR package provides a comprehensive way to extract information from natural language endoscopy ann pathology reports as well as merging the two datasets so that pathology specimens are relevant to the endoscopy they came from. Furthermore the package also provides functions for the following types of analysis of endoscopic and pathological datasets: • 1. Patient surveillance. Examples including determining when patients should return for surveillance and who is overdue. • 2.

The majority of research has been conducted in Spain or the United States, with no studies of dietary intervention published in the United Kingdom. Restrictive elimination diets can be challenging and swallowed topical corticosteroids have also been shown to be an effective treatment in adults. Despite their efficacy, disadvantages include risk of candidiasis,3 potential long‐term effects such as adrenal suppression3 and off‐label medication use. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective for a proportion of patients  although with both PPIs and corticosteroids, the underlying triggers of this presumed antigen‐mediated condition are not identified and continued use is required to maintain efficacy. A key aspect in the management of any allergic disease is avoidance of relevant allergens.Through a multidisciplinary collaboration between Adult Allergy, Gastroenterology, and Dietetics, we launched a service to provide dietary intervention for adults with EoE in a UK tertiary referral centre. We recently undertook a retrospective evaluation with the aim to describe the clinical phenotype of EoE in our service and to determine the clinico‐pathological response to dietary or medical interventions in this cohort (GSTT service evaluation 6195).","tags":[],"title":"Multidisciplinary approach to the management of adult eosinophilic oesophagitis in the United Kingdom","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
