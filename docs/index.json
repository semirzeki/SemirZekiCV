Evidence suggests that this increased risk is due to field cancerization -- the formation of histologically undistinguishable field of clonally derived, mutant cells within the Barrett's segment. Field cancerization can occur prior to both dysplasia and invasive neoplasia and potentially provides a mechanism for the development of multifocal and metachronous tumors. In the gastrointestinal tract, mutant clones spread predominately by crypt fission; the same is likely to be true in Barrett's lesions. Epithelial interactions in the form of cooperation or competition between epithelial clones, as well as with stromal cells, may further drive clone growth. Field cancerization is a clinically relevant phenomenon, knowledge of which could influence the size of resection margins to enhance prognosis after curative surgery, as well as provide a rationale for the development of effective biomarkers for neoplasia risk in Barrett's esophagus. This may provide a foundation for streamlined surveillance programs to prevent the development of invasive tumors.","tags":[],"title":"Field cancerization in Barrett's esophagus.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeki S","Fitzgerald RC."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"1f725486fffd02c0455a5b3e8308646d","permalink":"/publication/targetingcare/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/targetingcare/","section":"publication","summary":"Barretts oesophagus represents the most significant risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), although the majority of patients will not develop cancer. However, early detection of OAC and its precursors significantly improves outcome and underlines the importance of endoscopic surveillance programmes. Clearly there is a discrepancy between the small number of people who need to undergo surveillance because they are at significant progression risk, and the large number that do. Research is therefore now concentrated on risk stratification. Currently such stratification is currently based on clinical findings, endoscopic diagnosis and histopathological grade. Histopathology can be imperfect and is likely to require molecular confirmation of different grades, thus molecular stratification is becoming more important in this regard and p53 immunohistochemistry is already clinically useful, with other molecular biomarkers likely to prove beneficial in the future. The hope is that non-endoscopic methods, such as the Cytosponge may be able to combine molecular biomarkers with histopathology and therefore perhaps benefit a population screening as well as a surveillance programme.","tags":[],"title":"Targeting care in Barrett's oesophagus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lavery DL","Nicholson AM","Poulsom R","Jeffery R","Hussain A","Gay LJ","Jankowski JA","Zeki SS","Barr H","Harrison R"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"1f9df783c59a78b1dafc266d2a0b1035","permalink":"/publication/stemcellorganisationandproliferative/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stemcellorganisationandproliferative/","section":"publication","summary":"POBJECTIVE: Barrett's oesophagus shows appearances described as 'intestinal metaplasia', in structures called 'crypts' but do not typically display crypt architecture. Here, we investigate their relationship to gastric glands. METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration within Barrett's glands was assessed by Ki67 and iododeoxyuridine (IdU) labelling. Expression of mucin core proteins (MUC), trefoil family factor (TFF) peptides and LGR5 mRNA was determined by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridisation, and clonality was elucidated using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations combined with mucin histochemistry. RESULTS: Proliferation predominantly occurs in the middle of Barrett's glands, diminishing towards the surface and the base: IdU dynamics demonstrate bidirectional migration, similar to gastric glands. Distribution of MUC5AC, TFF1, MUC6 and TFF2 in Barrett's mirrors pyloric glands and is preserved in Barrett's dysplasia. MUC2-positive goblet cells are localised above the neck in Barrett's glands, and TFF3 is concentrated in the same region. LGR5 mRNA is detected in the middle of Barrett's glands suggesting a stem cell niche in this locale, similar to that in the gastric pylorus, and distinct from gastric intestinal metaplasia. Gastric and intestinal cell lineages within Barrett's glands are clonal, indicating derivation from a single stem cell. CONCLUSIONS:Barrett's shows the proliferative and stem cell architecture, and pattern of gene expression of pyloric gastric glands, maintained by stem cells showing gastric and intestinal differentiation: neutral drift may suggest that intestinal differentiation advances with time, a concept critical for the understanding of the origin and development of Barrett's oesophagus.","tags":[],"title":"The stem cell organisation, and the proliferative and gene expression profile of Barrett's epithelium, replicates pyloric-type gastric glands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeki S","Fitzgerald RC."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544140800,"objectID":"e0c4c3dd6bf034ca2a841e3765cd8240","permalink":"/publication/molecularmarkers/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/molecularmarkers/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to stratify patients based on the risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma would provide benefit to patients as well as deliver a more cost effective surveillance programme. Current practice is to survey all patients with Barrett's oesophagus (BO) and use histological diagnoses to guide further management. However, reliance on histology alone has its drawbacks. We are currently unable to reliably stratify the risk of progression of patients with non-dysplastic BO based on any particular histological feature. There is also considerable variability in histological interpretation. An obvious recourse has been to rely on identifying molecular features possibly as an adjunct to histology, to better diagnose and stratify patients. To this end, p53 immunohistochemistry can be used as a useful adjunct to risk stratify and clarify histological grades, particularly low-grade dysplasia. Other markers of progression, although not yet in a clinically applicable format, are promising. Measurements of promoter methylation and also genomic instability such as loss of heterozygosity and copy number alterations show promise especially as high throughput genetic technologies reach maturity. The enduring hope is that these molecular biomarkers will make the transition to clinical applicability either in the direct endoscopic setting or even using non-endoscopic methods.","tags":[],"title":"The use of molecular markers in predicting dysplasia and guiding treatment.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

BE patients who progressed to high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC (n = 130) and BE patients who never progressed (n = 130) were matched on age, sex, length of the BE segment, and duration of endoscopic surveillance. All progressors had minimum 2 years of endoscopic surveillance without HGD/EAC to exclude prevalent neoplasia. We assessed abnormal DNA content, p53, Cyclin A, and Aspergillus oryzae lectin (AOL) in FFPE sections. We performed conditional logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) of progression based on biomarker status.Expert LGD (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 1.7–41.0), AOL (3 vs. 0 epithelial compartments abnormal; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2–10.6) and p53 (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.6) were independently associated with neoplastic progression. Cyclin A did not predict progression and DNA ploidy analysis by image cytometry was unsuccessful in the majority of cases, both were excluded from the multivariate analysis. The multivariable biomarker model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73.Expert LGD, AOL, and p53 independently predict neoplastic progression in BE patients and are applicable to routine practice.

We next screened a cohort of 109 biopsies from 2 key transition points in the development of malignancy: benign metaplastic never-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE; n=66) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD; n=43). Unexpectedly, the majority of recurrently mutated genes in EAC were also mutated in NDBE. Only TP53 and SMAD4 mutations occurred in a stage-specific manner, confined to HGD and EAC, respectively. Finally, we applied this knowledge to identify high-risk Barrett's esophagus in a new non-endoscopic test.

However, in 20% of cases RFA fails to return the epithelium to squamous phenotype. Follow-up studies show a similar dysplasia recurrence rate. We hypothesize that failed RFA is due to clonally mutated epithelial populations harbored in RFA-privileged sites and that RFA can select for the mutant clonal expansionMETHODS:A longitudinal case series of 19 patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma were studied. DNA was extracted from individual Barrett's glands, deep esophageal glands within mucosal resections and biopsy specimens before and after RFA. Mutations were identified by targeted sequencing of genes commonly mutated in Barrett's adenocarcinoma.RESULTS:Five patients demonstrated persistent post-RFA pathology with persistent mutations, sometimes detected in deep esophageal glands or neighboring squamous epithelium after several rounds of RFA preceded by mucosal resection. Recurrence of pathology in three other patients was characterized by de novo mutations.CONCLUSIONS:Protumorigenic mutations can be found in post-ablation squamous mucosa as well as in mutant deep esophageal glands; both are associated with dysplasia recurrence. Following RFA, non-dysplastic Barrett's epithelium can contain mutant clones that are found in a subsequent adenocarcinoma. Ablation may also drive the clonal expansion of pre-existing clones after a “bottleneck” created by the RFA. Overall, recurrence of dysplasia post RFA reflects the multicentric origins of Barrett's clones and highlights the role of clonal selection in carcinogenesis.","tags":[],"title":"Clonal Selection and Persistence in Dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus and Intramucosal Cancers After Failed Radiofrequency Ablation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Zeki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"7672e455307c75800bd123b41cc3b8fe","permalink":"/publication/endominer/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/endominer/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical data is increasingly kept in an electronic format worldwide (Bretthauer M. 2016).This serves many purposes including more efficient storage, distribution and accessibility of patient-focussed data. As important is the ability to analyse healthcare data for to optimize resource deployment and usage. The tools for the analysis are often statistical and rely on the provision of ‘clean’ datasets before this can be done. ‘Cleaning’ a dataset is often the most difficult aspect of any data analysis and involves the provision of meaningful and well-formatted data so that the interpretation of the analysis is not subject to the doubts of the data quality. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends that all endoscopic data is kept in an electronic format particularly to facilitate audit and maintain standards through the Global Rating Scale (GRS) (Stebbing J. 2011). The endoscopic dataset is however only part of the patient’s story as many aspects of a patient’s gastroenterological care depend on the results of histopathological analysis of tissue taken during the examination. Pathology results are often available many days after the endoscopic result and usually stored in a separate data repository, although this may change with the arrival of an encompassing electronic patient record. Regardless of the method of storage, it is often difficult to associate the particular histopathological result with an endoscopic result. Further, even if the two data sets can be merged, a problem occurs in the isolation of various parts of each report such that each part can be individually analysed. Examples include the isolation of who the endoscopist was or the presence of dysplasia within a histopathology report. This is all the more difficult if the report is unstructured or partially structured free text. However if this can be done then many downstream analyses which benefit individual patients as well as the department, can be automated and include more complex analyses to determine follow-up regimes or endoscopic –pathologic lesion recognition performance. The EndoMineR package provides a comprehensive way to extract information from natural language endoscopy ann pathology reports as well as merging the two datasets so that pathology specimens are relevant to the endoscopy they came from. Furthermore the package also provides functions for the following types of analysis of endoscopic and pathological datasets: • 1. Patient surveillance. Examples including determining when patients should return for surveillance and who is overdue. • 2. Patient tracking. -Examples include determining the length of time since the last endoscopy, as well as aggregate functions such as finding how many endoscopies of a certain type have been done and predicting future burden.","tags":[],"title":"EndoMineR for the extraction of endoscopic and associated pathology data from medical reports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hannah Hunter","Kristina Pupinyte","Terry Wong","Sebastian Zeki","Jason M.

These stem cells reside in a niche at the base of the crypt, which controls their behavior and maintains the stem cell's homeostasis through a variety of signaling pathways and interactions.

Although the crypt base contains several stem cells, each colonic crypt comprises a single clone of cells. Investigators have attempted to reconcile these apparently contradictory observations by conducting research into stem cell division. The propagation of stem-cell-acquired mutations through a crypt results in a monocryptal adenoma that, through crypt fission, develops into a microadenoma. Some early adenomas become polyclonal through an as yet unknown mechanism. The discovery of subpopulations of cancer cells that can initiate tumors when implanted into mice has renewed interest in the existence of cancer stem cells, especially with regard to their implications for the use of chemotherapy.
